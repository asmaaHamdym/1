        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Asmaa Hamdy. I live in Cairo, Egypt with my husband and my
          three beautiful children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I work at CFG(Code First Girls) as a freelance coding
          instructor teaching JavaScript and Python. Before I worked at MPL(Misr
          Public Library) teaching Computer Science and programming to children.
          I also worked as a desktop developer for two years working with C++
          and Oracle DBMS. I am currently working on building my portfolio as a
          front-end developer.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some random facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I love the smells of wood, baking and grinding coffee.</li>
          <li>
            I am proud of myself for having and raising two twin boys(hardest
            thing I have ever done!).
          </li>
          <li>My favorite place ever is the Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo.</li>
        </ul>
